1. Wake up at 5 am to be productive.
This is a myth.

Your productivity depends on your circadian rhythms.
Everyone is different.

Wake up at a time that's natural for you and fits with your lifestyle.
2. The Pomodoro Technique.

Work for 25 minutes, take a break, then repeat.
This technique ignores your productivity and momentum.
If you're in the flow, why stop?
Work until you need to take a break.

3. Multitasking.

Multitasking splits your focus and hurts your productivity.
You're not a computer.
Your brain can't juggle 2 things at once.
Focus on 1 task at a time.

4. Online to-do lists.

To-do lists are useful, but online to-do lists are not.
You're just giving yourself more distractions.
Write your to-do list on paper or in a notebook.

5. Productivity apps.

Productivity apps are just more distractions.
There's no app that will make you more productive.
Your productivity depends on your habits and mindset.

6. Inbox zero.

Inbox zero is not achievable.
There will always be more emails coming in.
Focus on responding to important emails and ignore the rest.

7. Blocking out your day.

This technique makes you want to rebel against your own schedule.
Life is unpredictable.
Block out your calendar if you want, but don't be too rigid.

8. Taking cold showers.

This technique is supposed to increase your alertness and productivity.
But the effect is temporary.
If you want to take a cold shower because you enjoy it, go for it.
But don't waste your time for the sake of productivity.

9. Working longer hours.

Working for longer hours does not mean you're being more productive.
It's the quality of your work that matters.
Take breaks, go for walks, and take care of yourself.

10. Being busy.

Busyness is not the same as productivity.
You can be busy all day and not get anything done.
Focus on completing important tasks, not just being busy.
That's the real way to be productive.
