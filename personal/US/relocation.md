Senior Software Development Engineer

Design and development of large-scale, multi-tiered, multi-threaded distributed software applications, tools, systems and services using Object Oriented Design, distributed programming, C++ and Python. Translate functional requirements into robust, efficient, supportable solutions that worked well within the overall system architecture. Provide technical leadership and project management for all aspects of the software development lifecycle. Produce comprehensive, usable software documentation. Evaluate and make decisions around the use of new and existing software products and tools. Mentor junior development engineers.
Day-to-day responsibilities include:
- Leveraging Machine Learning, Algorithms optimization, and programming in the Speech Domain to maintain and optimize existing automatic speech recognition capabilities for Alexa;
- Designing and developing new automatic speech recognition capabilities and algorithms for Alexa;
- Designing, developing, and testing Alexa software;
- Creating new metrics and leveraging existing metrics to monitor runtime performance for speed and accuracy;
- Providing operational support and problem solving expertise for Amazon’s large scale infrastructure;
- Continuously expanding ASR capabilities for existing languages and adding new language support for Alexa.
- Profiling ASR Engine software with such tools as gprof, Intel VTune, Lttng.

The following Amazon-specific tools and technologies in day-to-day job duties:	Monitor Portal, iGraph, Carnaval, Trouble Tickets, CR and CM, DevDesktop, PacExplorer, NeMo, AWS, Brazil Build System, Apollo, Amazon Pipelines, Coral Service Framework


Object-oriented design using modern design patterns, Multi-threaded programming, C++ code analysis with profiling tools and code optimization for high performance. Software and Project management.


I was part of a Text To Speech (TTS) Engine and SDK [Software Developmet Kit] Team. The TTS Engine and SDK team provides text to speech capabilities on Amazon’s Alexa Platform and Alexa enabled devices. The TTS Engine and SDK team continuously enhances TTS capabilities for new domains and languages, design to operate at a very large scale with industry leading TTS performance. I acted as team leader on several major projects while on the TTS Engine and SDK team. Under my guidance, the team reached the first milestone of the project Multi-Purpose Add-ons (MPA) Continuous Deployment project. I initiated this project, went through local reviews and review with Principal Engineer, Played key role in designing MPA format, logic of loading / replacing / stacking / merging different type of TTS data loaded with MPA on run time. Contributed to key functionality and code review of the peers. This project allowed the continuous deployment of TTS Data to the Amazon Alexa and Polly service with Multi-Purpose Add-ons. TTS Data includes language models, acoustic and phrasing DNN [Deep Neural Netwok] models, PLSes [Pronounciation Lexicon Spesification], regular expressions, lexicons, unit/joint blacklists, and word embedding data bases. He also completed work for the DNN Project, which including supporting multi IO [Input/Output] DNN models which enabled support for the new Japanese voice service for Amazon Polly.

Day-to-day roles were:

- Maintaining and optimizing existing text to speech capabilities for Alexa;
- Designing and developing new text to speech capabilities and algorithms for Alexa;
- Designing, developing, and testing Alexa software; Creating new metrics and leveraging existing metrics to monitor runtime performance for speed and accuracy;
- Providing operational support and problem solving expertise for large scale infrastructure;
- Continuously expanding TTS capabilities for existing languages and adding new language support;
- Providing operational support.

I was working on applying different synthesis techniques to domains such as News, Ebooks, Speech connotation, Jokes, etc.  TTS Engine using Unit Selection technique, which means that speech is synthesized from the small peaces of audio (units). In order to find the best sequence of the units for particular sentence from Unit Data Base for particular voice (which consist of million units),  for each sentence graph of all possible units is build and Viterbi Search Algorithm is run agains this graph, main function in this routine is Unit Selection Cost Function (called million times per each sentence and very critical for performance), which is used to select the units which fit best by number (from 20 to 378) of acoustic and linguistic features of each unit] [Please insert 2-3 sentences detailed how you used some of the Amazon technologies listed above (Apollo, Brazil, etc) to complete your work at Amazon-Poland [Sergey] For TTS Engine design, development and build I use: Amazon CR board for Code review, Brazil for building tools and packages with TTS Engine binaries, produced binaries are stored on AWS S3, then Brazil packages with new TTS Engine binaries are pushed to AWS EC2 hosts configures with Apollo , running Amazon Pipelines to push the binaries to Prod to the cloud - AWS Amazon service Polly (https://aws.amazon.com/ru/polly/) and Alexa (https://aws.amazon.com/ru/awis/)]. For these reasons that Mr. Didenko has been identified as a key employee for transfer to the U.S.

Day-to-day roles were:

- Maintaining and optimizing existing text to speech capabilities for Alexa;
- Designing and developing new text to speech capabilities and algorithms for Alexa;
- Designing, developing, and testing Alexa software; Creating new metrics and leveraging existing metrics to monitor runtime performance for speed and accuracy;
- Providing operational support and problem solving expertise for large scale infrastructure;
- Continuously expanding TTS capabilities for existing languages and adding new language support;
- Providing operational support to release TTS SDK packages every two (2) weeks.
