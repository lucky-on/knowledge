Tenets
- Architecture is about intent. The architecture of code/components/packages should clearly express its intent.
- Coupling is not a bad thing, this is what make a System, but ACCIDENTAL coupling is bad!

- A good architecture allows major decisions to be deferred. A good architect maximizes the number of decisions not made. ((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsjsiz2A9mg))
- SOLID
  - The Single Responsibility principle
  - The Open-Closed principle
  - The Liskov Substitution principle
  - The Interface Segregation principle:
  - The Dependency Inversion principle: High level concepts are independent and Low level concepts depend on High level concepts.

- TDD, CDD, PDD
- The Tuckman cycle (Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing)
- Maslow hierarchy of need
- Empowerment
- Certification

- Add global_data_ to PipeBuilder and Pipe

More you learn - less you know - keep learn more and become an expert (The Dunning-Kruger Effect)

Illusion of explanatory depth

It is hard to get full list of requirements for each customer, so we need to come up with architecture
which, with incremental changes can evolve to satisfy old and new customers naturally.
